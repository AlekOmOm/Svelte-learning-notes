# 1. Introduction to Svelte

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern JavaScript **compiler** that turns your declarative component code into efficient, imperative JavaScript that directly manipulates the DOM.

## Key Difference: Compiler vs. Framework

- **Traditional Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular):**
  - These frameworks do most of their work in the _browser_ at _runtime_. They ship framework code along with your application code, which the browser needs to execute to make your app work (e.g., using a Virtual DOM).
- **Svelte (Compiler):**
  - Svelte does its work during the _build step_ (compilation). It analyzes your component code and generates highly optimized, framework-less vanilla JavaScript. This means smaller bundle sizes and potentially faster performance because there's no framework overhead in the browser.

## Why Choose Svelte?

- **Less Code:** Svelte's syntax is designed to be concise, often requiring less boilerplate than other frameworks.
- **No Virtual DOM:** Svelte surgically updates the real DOM directly when state changes, which can be more performant.
- **Truly Reactive:** Reactivity is built into the language (especially with Svelte 5 Runes like `$state`), making state management feel natural.
- **Great Performance:** Smaller bundles and direct DOM manipulation lead to fast load times and a snappy user experience.
- **Easy to Learn:** Many find Svelte's component structure and reactivity model intuitive.
